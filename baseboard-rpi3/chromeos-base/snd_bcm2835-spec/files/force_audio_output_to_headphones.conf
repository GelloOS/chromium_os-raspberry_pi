description     "Force setting audio output to headphone for Raspberry Pi 3b/3b+/4b"
author          "yang@fydeos.io"

# The cras (chrome os audio service) is uncompatiable with Pi's audio driver, the 
# default output is "auto", that will make cras confused.
# According to https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Sound
# If you want to enable hdmi audio, modify the last param to 
#         0    # unplug headphone, use hdmi instead (if hdmi audio is exist)
#         1    # plug headphone
